This is my First Web Development Project - Part of the odin project learning curriculum. 

The Project is called 'Recipes'. 

THe idea is to use HTML to create a invetory of recipes found online and put them nicely on to a single page such that itis easy for users to get all recipes at one location. 

Some of the HTML concepts that will be used are:

1. HTML Boilerplate
2. Use <strong> and <em> elment to highlight important text
3. Include Links using <a>
4. Add images using <img>
