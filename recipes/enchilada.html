        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A yummy mix of veggies, refried black beans, and easy homemade 
            enchilada sauce! A tasty change from boring old bean and cheese 
            enchiladas.</p>

        <p>
            <strong>These vegetarian enchiladas are a hearty and satisfying 
                dinner.</strong>  Make them on a weeknight and you’ll enjoy 
                leftovers for lunch the next day. Or make it on the weekend 
                and invite friends over to make a party out of it! You 
                could make a double batch and freeze the extras—you’ll find 
                freezing instructions below.
        </p>

        <p><strong>You’ll love the fresh filling in these enchiladas,</strong> made of 
            sautéed bell pepper, broccoli, onion, spinach, black beans and 
            warming spices. These enchiladas are nicely cheesy, but not 
            overwhelmingly cheesy like many restaurants make them.</p>

        <p><strong>If you’ve never made enchiladas before, you can do it!
            </strong></p>

        <h3>How to Make Enchiladas</h3>

        <p><strong>This recipe isn’t the quickest dinner option (enchiladas 
            never are), but it is totally worth the effort.</strong> 
            Here’s a basic rundown with some notes and variations.</p>

        <p><strong>You’ll start by making 
            <a href="https://cookieandkate.com/enchilada-sauce-recipe/" 
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">red enchilada 
            sauce</a></strong> , a simple, pantry-friendly recipe using 
            dried spices and vegetable broth. It has an amazing depth of 
            flavor! If you want to change it up, you could use 
            <a href="https://cookieandkate.com/easy-green-enchilada-sauce/"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">green enchilada sauce
            </a> instead, which is made from salsa verde (jarred is fine).</p>

        <p><strong>Then, you’ll sauté red onion, bell pepper, broccoli and 
            spinach.</strong>Broccoli is an uncommon ingredient in enchiladas. 
            If you’re hesitant and want a more neutral flavor, 
            substitute cauliflower instead. Cumin and a small amount 
            of cinnamon (yes, cinnamon!) ramp up the flavor</p>

        <p><strong>Once the vegetables are done cooking,</strong>we’ll transfer them to a 
            bowl and add drained black beans, plus a small amount of cheese 
            and a splash of enchilada sauce for flavoring. Then we’ll assemble 
            the enchiladas, drizzle the remaining sauce, sprinkle with cheese, 
            and bake until golden. If you want extra cheesy enchiladas, you 
            could double the cheese (use a full 8 ounces).</p>

        <p><strong>This recipe calls for flour tortillas. </strong>I like to use whole wheat 
            for some extra flavor and fiber. Corn tortillas are more traditional, 
            but my mom always used flour tortillas in her enchiladas when we were
            growing up, so I used flour. If you’d like to use corn tortillas, 
            you certainly can. You’ll need more than 8 of them, likely 12. 
            Gently warm them in the microwave or one at a time on the stovetop 
            before using (otherwise, they might break when rolling).</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 cups <a href="https://cookieandkate.com/enchilada-sauce-recipe/" 
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">homemade enchilada sauce</a>
            </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped red onion (about 1 small red onion)</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>1 bunch of broccoli or 1 small head of cauliflower (about 1 pound), 
                florets removed and sliced into small, bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon/li>
            <li>5 to 6 ounces baby spinach (about 5 cups, packed)</li>
            <li>1 can (15 ounces) black beans, drained and rinsed, or 1 ½ cups 
                cooked black beans</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon fine salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>8 whole wheat tortillas (about 8 inches in diameter)</li>
            <li>Handful of chopped cilantro, for garnishing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit with one rack in the middle of 
                the oven and one in the upper third. Lightly grease a 9 by 13-inch 
                pan with olive oil or cooking spray.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the olive oil until 
                simmering. Add the onions and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, 
                until the onions are tender and translucent, about 5 to 7 minutes. 
                Add the broccoli and bell pepper, stir, and reduce heat to 
                medium-low. Cover the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, 
                for about 8 to 9 minutes, or until the broccoli is brighter green 
                and just starting to turn golden on the edges.</li>
            <li>Add the cumin and cinnamon to the skillet and cook until fragrant, 
                about 30 seconds. Add the spinach, a few handfuls at a time, stirring 
                until it has reduced in size. Repeat with the remaining spinach and 
                cook until all of the spinach has wilted.</li>
            <li>Transfer the contents of the pan to a medium mixing bowl. Add the 
                drained beans, ¼ cup cheese and a drizzle of enchilada sauce 
                (about 2 tablespoons). Season with ½ teaspoon salt and some 
                freshly ground black pepper, to taste.</li>
            <li>Assemble the enchiladas: Pour ¼ cup enchilada sauce into your 
                prepared pan and tilt it from side to side until the bottom of 
                the pan is evenly coated. To assemble your first enchilada, 
                spread ½ cup filling mixture down the middle of a tortilla, 
                then snugly wrap the left side over and then the right, to make 
                a wrap. Place it seam-side down against the edge of your pan. 
                Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the remaining enchilada sauce evenly over the enchiladas, 
                leaving the tips of the enchiladas bare. Sprinkle the remaining 
                shredded cheese evenly over the enchiladas.</li>
            <li>Bake, uncovered, on the middle rack for 20 minutes. If the cheese 
                on top isn’t golden enough for your liking, carefully transfer 
                the enchiladas to the upper rack of the oven and bake for an 
                additional 3 to 6 minutes, until sufficiently golden and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and let the enchiladas rest for 10 minutes 
                (they’re super hot!). Before serving, sprinkle chopped cilantro 
                down the center of the enchiladas. Serve immediately. Leftovers 
                will keep well for up to 4 days in the refrigerator, covered.</li>
        </ol>
