        <h3>What is Poha?</h3>

        <p>Poha is a traditional Indian breakfast or snack made with flattened rice, 
            spices, peanuts, onions, and potatoes. There are many different 
            variations of poha; the poha recipe today is for kanda
            batata poha, meaning an onion and potato poha.</p>

        <p>The word “poha” refers to both the dish and the flattened rice used 
            to make it. So, we’re making poha (the dish) with poha 
            (flattened rice).</p>
        
        <p>Flattened rice cooks very quickly because it has already been parboiled, 
            flattened, and dried. You might find packages of poha labeled as 
            either <a href="https://amzn.to/3toJN9j" target="_blank" 
            rel="noopener noreferrer">“thick poha”</a> or “thin poha” – for this recipe, we want to 
            use thick, or regular, poha. You can find this at your local 
            Indian grocery store or on <a 
            href="https://myheartbeets.com/recommends/poha/" 
            rel="noopener noreferrer">amazon</a>. </p>

        <h3>How to Make Poha</h3>

        <p>To make this poha, add a few ingredients – including potatoes – to the 
            instant pot, mix, and pressure cook for 1 minute. The potatoes will 
            cook quickly because they’re small (½ to ¾ inch pieces). You don’t 
            want to have big chunks of potato in poha, so make sure to chop them 
            into small pieces.</p>

        <p>After that, add rinsed poha to the pot and mix well. Turn the pot off, 
            put the lid back on, and let the poha sit in the pot – poha cooks 
            very quickly and will cook in the residual steam.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Press saute, then add oil. Once it heats up, add cumin and mustard 
                seeds. When the cumin starts to brown, add peanuts, hing, and 
                curry leaves and stir-fry for 2 minutes, or until the peanuts 
                are roasted.</li>
            <li>Remove the peanuts and curry leaves from the pot. Set aside 
                for now.</li>
            <li>Add the onions, green chilies, potatoes and stir-fry for a minute, 
                add spices, stir, then add water and mix well.</li>
            <li>Secure the lid, close the pressure valve, and cook for 1 minute 
                at high pressure (the diced potatoes will cook in this amount 
                of time due to their size).</li>
            <li>Quick-release – right after you turn the knob to quick release, 
                rinse the poha, then remove the lid of the instant pot, and add 
                the poha to the pot along with the raisins. Gently mix. Secure the 
                lid and turn off the instant pot. Let the poha steam in residual 
                heat for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the lid, add the roasted peanuts, curry leaves back into 
                the pot along with lemon juice, and cilantro and gently mix well.</li>
            <li>Place it in a bowl and serve.</li>
        </ol>
